# AssistGo! Android App

**AssistGo!** is a mobile application designed to make communication on Android phones accessible right out of the box. The default Android user interface can be cluttered with unnecessary features, detracting from the phone's primary purposeâ€”communication for daily and emergency use. While Android provides a wide range of accessibility configurations, setting these up requires awareness and technical know-how, which can pose a challenge for many users.

AssistGo! offers a simplified user interface to help individuals with accessibility issues (such as visual impairments, limited literacy, or language barriers) access essential communication features like voice/video calls and messaging. The app also makes it easy to manage contacts and includes an in-app translation tool, allowing users to overcome language barriers without the need for third-party apps. Additionally, users can easily contact local emergency services without needing to search for numbers. In short, AssistGo! provides a streamlined solution for communication.
